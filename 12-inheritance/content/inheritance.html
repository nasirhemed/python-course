## Intro to Python 
### Inheritance 
#### Nasir Hemed

</script></section><section ><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Inheritance 

- One of the most common concepts in OOP is inheritance 
- Inheritance is the ability to define a new class that is a modified version of a class 
- The relationship is usually denoted as parent-child relationship 

</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

### Example of Inheritance 

- Let's say there was a class for Animal
  - Animal can sleep and make noises

```python
class Animal:
  def __init__(self):
    self.heart = 4

  def sleep(self):
    print("Sleeping: ZZZZZZ")

  def make_noise(self):
    print("animal is making noises")
```

</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

### Example of Inheritance 
- Let's say we now have a Dog and a Cat
  - They are both animals. They can sleep and make noises 

```python
class Dog(Animal):
  def make_noise(self):
    print("Whoof Whoof")

class Cat(Animal):
  def make_noise(self):
    print("Meow Meow")
```

</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

### Example of Inheritance

- So now if we define a cat and a dog, we get this:

```python
>>> a = Animal()
>>> c = Cat()
>>> d = Dog()
>>> a.make_noise()
"animal is making noises"
>>> d.make_noise()
"Whoof Whoof"
>>> c.make_noise()
"Meow Meow"
```

</script></section></section><section ><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Back to Cards 

- For any card game, we need to represent a hand of cards 
- A hand is kinda similar to a deck
- A hand is also different from a deck
  - We might need to compute whether we are winning
  - We might need to know what card we should play
- Thus, we will inheritance from Deck to make Hand class 

</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

- A hand usually starts with empty cards
- We will use a name to indicate the name of the player

```python
class Hand(Deck):
  def __init__(self, name=""):
    self.cards = []
    self.name = name
```

</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

- Unlike a Deck, we may need to add a card back to a Hand
  - We will have an `add` method 

```python
class Hand(Deck):
  ...
  def add(self, card):
    self.cards.append(card)
```

</script></section></section><section ><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

### Dealing Cards 
- Now that we have a Hand class, we want to deal cards from the `Deck` to the hands
  - Since this is usually what a Deck of cards do it makes sense to put it in the `Deck` class

```python
class Deck:
    ...
    def deal(self, hands, num_cards=999):
        num_hands = len(hands)
        for i in range(num_cards):
            if self.is_empty():
                break                    # Break if out of cards
            card = self.pop()            # Take the top card
            hand = hands[i % num_hands]  # Whose turn is next?
            hand.add(card)               # Add the card to the hand
```

</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

- The first parameter is the hands (players) you will distribute the cards to
- The second parameter is the number of cards you will distribute in total 
  - Default is a big number because we will distribute all cards

</script></section></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">

### Printing a Hand

- Now let's say we want to print a Hand
- Luckily, the hand already inherits `__str__` from `Deck`

```python
>>> deck = Deck()
>>> deck.shuffle()
>>> hand = Hand("frank")
>>> deck.deal([hand], 5)
>>> print(hand)
2 of Spades
3 of Spades
4 of Spades
Ace of Hearts 
9 of Clubs
```


</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">

### Implementing Card Game 

- Now that we have a `Deck` and `Hand`, we can implement a game 
- Typically, before starting the game, you get a Deck of cards and shuffle them
  - So that is what we're gonna do

```python
class CardGame:
    def __init__(self):
        self.deck = Deck()
        self.deck.shuffle()
```

- Now we can implement specific card game of our choice and add features
  - Blackjack, ..., etc. 

</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">

### Old Maid Game 

- Matching Game 
- Goal is to get rid of matching card from your hand 
  - Matching cards have same rank and colour
- Queen of Clubs removed so that Queen of Spades does not have a match 
- Players start trading cards when there is no more match
- Game ends when the last player only has one card left 

</script></section><section ><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

### Old Maid Hand 
- An Old Maid Hand requires some ability to find and remove matches 
- Everything else is the same as `Hand` however, so we can inherit from it 

```python
class OldMaidHand(Hand):
    def remove_matches(self):
        count = 0
        original_cards = self.cards[:]
        for card in original_cards:
            match = Card(3 - card.suit, card.rank)
            if match in self.cards:
                self.cards.remove(card)
                self.cards.remove(match)
                print("Hand {0}: {1} matches {2}"
                        .format(self.name, card, match))
                count += 1
        return count
```

</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

### Example

```python
>>> game = CardGame()
>>> hand = OldMaidHand("frank")
>>> game.deck.deal([hand], 13)
>>> hand.remove_matches()
Hand frank: 7 of Spades matches 7 of Clubs
Hand frank: 8 of Spades matches 8 of Clubs
Hand frank: 10 of Diamonds matches 10 of Hearts
```

</script></section></section><section ><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

### Old Maid Game 

- Now we can focus on `OldMaidGame` class 
- We will inherit from `CardGame` class
- We will have a method `play` that starts this game 
  - It will remove Queen of Clubs
  - Deal the cards to the players 
  - Remove matches and start playing 

</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

### Implementation

```python
class OldMaidGame(CardGame):
    def play(self, names):
        # Remove Queen of Clubs
        self.deck.remove(Card(0,12))

        # Make a hand for each player
        self.hands = []
        for name in names:
            self.hands.append(OldMaidHand(name))

        # Deal the cards
        self.deck.deal(self.hands)
        print("---------- Cards have been dealt")
        self.print_hands() # TODO: Implemented below

        # Remove initial matches
        matches = self.remove_all_matches() # TODO: Implemented below
        print("---------- Matches discarded, play begins")
        self.print_hands()

        # Play until all 50 cards are matched
        turn = 0
        num_hands = len(self.hands)
        while matches < 25:
            matches += self.play_one_turn(turn) # TODO: Implemented below
            turn = (turn + 1) % num_hands

        print("---------- Game is Over")
        self.print_hands()
```

</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

### Removing matches 

```python
class OldMaidGame(CardGame):
    ...
    def remove_all_matches(self):
        count = 0
        for hand in self.hands:
            count += hand.remove_matches()
        return count
```

</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

### Printing hands

```python
class OldMaidGame(CardGame):
    ...
    def print_hands(self):
        count = 0
        for hand in self.hands:
            print("=====")
            print("Hand {} contains".format(hand.name))
            print(hand)
            print("====")
```

</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

### Player's turn to play 

- Idea is to find a neighbour and take a card from them
- Remove matches once you do that 


```python
class OldMaidGame(CardGame):
    ...
    def play_one_turn(self, i):
        if self.hands[i].is_empty():
            return 0
        neighbor = self.find_neighbor(i) # TODO: Implemented below
        picked_card = self.hands[neighbor].pop()
        self.hands[i].add(picked_card)
        print("Hand", self.hands[i].name, "picked", picked_card)
        count = self.hands[i].remove_matches()
        self.hands[i].shuffle()
        return count
```

</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

### Picking a neighbor 

- The idea here is to find the player right next to you (to your left)
- Take a card from them if they have a card 

```python
class OldMaidGame(CardGame):
    ...
    def find_neighbor(self, i):
        num_hands = len(self.hands)
        for next in range(1,num_hands):
            neighbor = (i + next) % num_hands
            if not self.hands[neighbor].is_empty():
                return neighbor
        return None
```

</script></section></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
