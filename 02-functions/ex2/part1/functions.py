# Write a program to calculate the area of a rectangle
# You will ask the user to give you values of width and height
# and then you will calculate the area

# First, define a function to calculate area
# This function will just take width and height and return 
# the area of the rectangle
def calculate_area(width, height):
    # TODO: Your code here
    pass # Remove this when you write your code

# Second: Ask the user to give you the width
# TODO: Your code here

# Make sure you convert it! You will need an int type

# Third: Ask the user to give you height
# TODO: Your code here

# Make sure you convert it! You will need an int type


# Fourth: Calculate the area
# TODO: Your code here

# Fifth: Print the output of the area
