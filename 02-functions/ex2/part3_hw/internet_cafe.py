# An internet cafe has 2 ways of charging. 
# If the user is a member pays 2$/hour, 
# Else the user pays 5$. 
# Find if someone is a member or not and calculate the price based on how many hours the user spend. 
# If the user is a member the tax is 10% else the tax is 20%.

# Create a program that:

# Reads how many hours the user spend
# Check if is a member
# Add the proper tax fee
# Print the total amount the user has to pay
# Output: "The user is a member stayed 2 hours for 2$/hour plus the 10% the total amount is 4.4$"
