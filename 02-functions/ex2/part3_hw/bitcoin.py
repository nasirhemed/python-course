# You've bought a Bitcoin and now it's on the rise!!!

# Create a program that:

# 1. Reads the value of the bitcoin at the time of purchase
# 2. Reads the percentage of increase (or decrease)
# 3. Prints the total value of your bitcoin
# 4. Prints the increase or decrease value


# Example: bitcoin_value = 10000, bitcoin_increase = 10
# Output: total_bitcoin_value = 11000, bitcoin_increase_value = 1000

# Hint: To calculate the increase value, it will be:
#       bitcoin_value * (bitcoin_increase / 100)
